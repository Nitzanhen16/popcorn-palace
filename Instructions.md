## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have installed the following:

- **Java JDK 21**  
  Ensure you have Java 21 installed. Verify using:

  ```sh
  java -version
  ```

- **Maven**  
  Used for building and testing the project.

  ```sh
  mvn -version
  ```

- **Docker and Docker Compose**  
  These are used to run the PostgreSQL database in a container.

- **Git** (optional)  
  To clone the repository if you havenâ€™t already: https://github.com/Nitzanhen16/popcorn-palace.git

## Setting Up the Database

The project uses a PostgreSQL database. You can run a PostgreSQL container using Docker Compose. Follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory**  
   Open a terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Git Bash) and navigate to the directory containing your `compose.yml` file:

   ```sh
   cd path/to/your/project
   ```

2. **Start the PostgreSQL Container**  
   Run the following command to start the container in detached mode:

   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Check if the Container Is Running**  
   Use the following command to list running containers:

   ```sh
   docker ps
   ```

   You should see your PostgreSQL container listed.

## Building the Project

The project uses Maven for build management.

1. **Clean and Build the Project**  
   Open a terminal in your project directory and run:

   ```sh
   mvn clean install
   ```

   This will compile the code, run tests, and package your application.

2. **Note:**
    - Ensure that your Maven dependencies (like `spring-boot-starter-test`, `jackson-databind`, etc.) are properly downloaded.
    - If you encounter any dependency issues, try:

      ```sh
      mvn clean install -U
      ```

---

## Running the Project

After a successful build, you can run the project using the Spring Boot Maven plugin.

1. **Run the Application**  
   In your project directory, execute:

   ```sh
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

   The application will start on port **8080** (as specified in `application.yaml`).

2. **Access the Application**  
   Open your browser and navigate to:

   ```
   http://localhost:8080
   ```

---

## Testing the Project

The project includes a test suite for controllers, services, and repositories.

### Running All Tests

To run the complete test suite, execute:

```sh
mvn test
```

### Testing Layers

- **Controller Tests:**  
  These tests simulate HTTP requests using `MockMvc` and verify responses. They use annotations like `@WebMvcTest` and (for now) `@MockBean` for mocking the service layer.

- **Service Tests:**  
  Unit tests for service methods using Mockito `@InjectMocks` and `@Mock` for mocking the repository layer.

- **Repository Tests:**  
  Integration tests using an in-memory H2 database (configured in `application.yaml`). They use annotations like `@DataJpaTest`

## Additional Information
please check out **docs** directory, it includes some additional files, that aren't part of the code scope

1. **API documentation**: S JSON collections file that can be imported into Postman, holds the entire API documentation and conveniently enables further testing of my project
2. 1. **roadmap.md**: A document that outlines the planned improvements and features to be added to the project.
